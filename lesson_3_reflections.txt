When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Remote repositories allow you to share your code with others so you can collaborate on projects and get feedback.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Because you may be working on a different version than what is in the remote repository. You could be in the middle of making some changes and suddenly your local repository is updated. There could be a bug in a commit on the remote repository and you wouldn't want that pulled automatically.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  A fork is when you copy another user's repository to your GitHub account and you'd use it when you want to modify someone else's code but can't/don't want to push it back to their repository. A clone is when you copy a repository from GitHub to your local machine and you'd want to do this so you can edit the code on your local machine instead of on GitHub. A branch is simply one path of commits.
