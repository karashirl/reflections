When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Remote repositories allow you to share your code with others so you can collaborate on projects and get feedback.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Because you may be working on a different version than what is in the remote repository. You could be in the middle of making some changes and suddenly your local repository is updated. There could be a bug in a commit on the remote repository and you wouldn't want that pulled automatically.
